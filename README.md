# Learning Large Language Models (LLMs)
This repository is a collection of valuable resources and interesting concepts I have encountered throughout my learning journey, with a focus on large language models. It covers a range of essential concepts as well as new and interesting topics to explore. Feel free to explore the [learning-resources.md](learning-resources.md) for a curated list of useful links and concepts. I will be updating the resources throughout my learning.
